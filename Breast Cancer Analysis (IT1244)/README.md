# How to run the project:

Follow the steps below:
1. Locate the "code" folder in the directory
2. Open the python file "predict.py"
3. Input the relevant data into the values of the "patient_data" dictionary
4. Run the python file
5. Obtain the predicted diagnosis from the output
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until satisfied

If step 4 does not work, install/update the following python packages:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy

To install the python packages:
- Windows: click the search bar, type "cmd", then type "pip install {package}", replace {package} with the name of the python package, and type it without quotations. If pip does not work, use pip3.
- Unix/macOS: click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type "terminal", then type "pip install {package}", replace {package} with the name of the python package, and type it without quotations. If pip does not work, use pip3.

If the method above is not working, ensure that pip is installed on your device by running the following commands in cmd/terminal:
1. curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
2. python get-pip.py

Last but not least, python is required on the device.
